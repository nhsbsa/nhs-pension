      Finding the right company to verify you
    </h1>
    <p>Certified companies have built new, secure systems to verify identities. These systems work by checking:
    </p>
    
    <ul class="list list-bullet">
      <li>your identity documents are valid </li>
      <li>it’s you providing your details, and not someone pretending to be you</li>
    </ul>
    <p>However, each company uses different methods for each of these steps.</p>
    <p>So we’ll now ask you some questions to check which companies can verify you. We’ll then send you to the website of the company you choose.</p>
